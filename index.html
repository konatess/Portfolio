                    <p class="card-text">
                    Born in Seattle to a commercial fisherman and a practitioner of the 
                    <em>Trager</em><sup>&#174;</sup> Approach, 
                    I grew up loving the ocean and the Northwest. 
                    After high school, I decided to spread my wings a bit and received a 
                    Bachelors in Liberal Arts with a special interest in Classical Asian Literature from Soka University of America, 
                    located in California. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="card-text">
                    While at Soka University, I studied abroad in China, 
                    which inspired me to teach English there after I graduated. 
                    Two adventure filled years later, I returned to Seattle to study massage 
                    and then the <em>Trager<sup>&#174;</sup></em> Approach at Discoverypoint School of Massage, 
                    where I later became a member of the faculty. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                    After five years of making the world a better place one massage at a time, I was ready for a new challenge. 
                    The short (and funnier) version of the story: My housemate and I were talking about her job at Microsoft, and she said, 
                    "You really liked the Symbolic Logic class at Soka, right?" When I answered in the affermative, she continued, 
                    "I have something you should read and see if you like it." A couple of days later, she handed me a textbook about 
                    programming in C which I enjoyed so much that I applied to coding bootcamp two weeks later.
